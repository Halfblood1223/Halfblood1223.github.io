# My personal website

## Workflow
- **Write locally using obsidian**
- **Publish using git if completed**
- **Put in the "inprogress" folder if not complete** | **Ignore that folder and other backend folders using gitignore**

## Pros
Very easy to use and low setup <br>
Doesn't require any fancy setup <br>
Troubleshooting is simple <br>
Writing can be done in markdown <br>

## Cons
Not very customizable <br>
No database - Leads to issues such as having to leave the entire images folder as user facing <br>
Have to clear cache to see new versions of the site <br>

## Conclusion
Overall works for my needs. Very simple to write on and takes the effort out of it.
