### Food
The food in NYC is unparalelled! With the sheer amount of amazing options available I found that my indecision was even worse than normal. However when I did decide I was almost always greeted with delicious food and amazing service. Here is the list of places I went to organized by day: <br>
*Saturday 06/19/21*
- [Naya Mezze and Grill](https://www.nayarestaurants.com/) | Rating: 7/10 | Cuisine: Lebanese-Mediterranean
- [Ferrara Bakery & Cafe](http://www.ferraranyc.com/) | Rating: 6/10 | Cuisine: Italian Pastries


Had 2 tiramisu's here. The first one was very hard with a consistency like ice cream. The second was very soft like a normal tiramisu. While I think the first one was a mistake I liked it more than the second one. If I had a metal spoon it would have been a great dessert but my plastic spoon ruined the experience. Good tiramisu.

*Sunday 06/20/21*
- [Liberty Bagels](https://libertybagelsny.com/midtown/) | Rating: 8/10 | Cuisine: NYC Bagels

Liberty Bagels really showed me the value of giving restaurants a second try. The first time I went to Liberty Bagels was on *06/20/21* and I ordered an *Everything Bagel with Lox and Butter*. This was possibly one of the worst bagels I had ever eaten and I couldn't even finish the whole thing. However the next time I came back on *06/22/21* I ordered an *Everything Bagel with Salmon and Butter*. This was one of the best bagels I have ever eaten and was a solid bagel 10. If I hadn't come back to Liberty and tried the right thing then I never would have discovered my favorite bagels. Goes to show that you should give things a second try.

*Monday 06/21/21*
- [Taiyaki NYC](https://taiyakinyc.com/) | Rating: 9/10 | Cuisine: Japanese Dessert

The *Beach, Please* ice cream was some of the best I've ever had. It was the perfect blend of sweet and savory. On top of that the taiyaki was soft and pancake like. Wishing I could take this back to Houston with me :sob:.
- [Mamoun's](https://mamouns.com/) | Rating: 5/10 | Cuisine: Middle-Eastern
- [Kati Roll Company](https://www.thekatirollcompany.com/) | Rating: 4/10 | Cuisine: Indian

Both of these establishments have been around since my dad lived in NYC. However I think that they are somewhat overrated. Mamoun's shawarma was amazing but the pita sandwich was almost half or two-thirds lettuce. My dad liked it however so that's why it got a 5 and not a 4. The Kati Roll Company was a similar story with the roti's being thin and the chicken being very dry. This one gets a 4 because neither of us liked it.
