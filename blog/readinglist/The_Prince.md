# The Prince
### Niccolo Machiavelli

#### In Progress Thoughts
###### 6/19/21 Page 57
So far I have enjoyed the book. This book can be divided into two major sections, practical statecraft, and subject ruler relations. So far the pages I have read are heavily based in the former. Some notable parts from this section of the book were:
- CH. Those who come to power by crime

This chapter highlights the difference between the existing schools of thought on how one should rule and Machiavelianism. In short, it details the rise of Agathocles and how he rose to power by committing a massacre of the important people of Syracuse. In this meteoric rise to power Machiavelli claims that we can learn a valuable lesson about the usefulness of cruelty. Essentially the core tenet for the use of cruelty, according to Machiavelli, is that **it must all be done in one fell swoop.** 
- Pg. 35

This page was interesting in it's endorsement of dependence as a tool of manipulation. Machiavelli says that promises mean nothing and that ruling through dependence and necessity is more efficient. This is something that I think is valuable and can be used throughout life to varying degrees.
- CH. Military organization and mercenary troops

This chapter details the usage of mercenary or foreign armies and their perils. While most of the chapter is practical statecraft an important point can be taken away from it. Machiavelli throughout the chapter as well as in other parts of the book details the fact that money cannot buy loyalty. He illustrates this point by examining the French takeover of parts of Italy and how mercenary troops became cowardly and failed to stop the invaders.

Overall the book is solid so far. I'm interested to get more into the subject ruler relationship portion of the book as that seems to have more practical applications to everyday life.
