This week I ran an Algebra camp for 5th through 9th graders. This experience was an eye opening look into teachers feel. The camp was split up into two groups of 5th-7th graders and 8th grade + .

Throughout the week I got to see them progress in their math skills. This all culminated on the last day of camp when my 2 students each got to give a small lesson to the other group of kids. Seeing the students use the knowledge that I had helped them achieve to help other people was a very fulfilling experience. Being a part of their future math success, while a heavy burden, was enlightening
