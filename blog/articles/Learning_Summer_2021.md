# Learning Summer 2021
## Math Summer 2021
### Math Course Selection Thought Process
Courses were selected in order to support my CS learning path. To take CS 189 next summer I will need a vector calculus, linear algebra, and probability course done. This summer I think that completing up to Calculus 1, and Linear Algebra is adequate to be able to take CS 189 by the end of next summer. It also allows me to take CS 188 sometime this year.
### Courses

Methods: Khan Academy. Dates: 6/1 - 6/15
Aptitude Test: Pre Calculus AB Final Exam Score of 85+

*Units Completed*

## CS Summer 2021
### CS Course Selection Thought Process
Courses were selected for several reasons. The primary one was to address my need for ML information to complete my 2021 ISEF project. CS 61a was selected as a prerequisite to this in order to get the most sound basis on ML, and in order to focus more on the conceptual understanding of ML as opposed to the code based understanding. This will set me up to take CS 189 in Sophomore Year summer as well as use this knowledge for my ISEF 2021-2022 project.

### Courses
#### CS 61a - Berkeley
I attempted CS 61a as my first coding course however the level of difficulty was too high for me. Substituted it with [Mit 6.00.1x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) and finished with a 96. I plan to attempt CS 61a in order to have a good basis in CS fundamentals before attempting more difficult concepts such as algorithms, and machine learning.

#### CS 188 - Berkeley
I want to take CS 188 as my intro to Machine Learning and AI course. The prerequisites are CS 61a, and CS 70. Both of those are Berkeley courses.

#### 6.00.2x - MITx
If possible I would like to re-attempt 6.00.2x. I started this course in the Fall of freshman year but was unable to complete this due to extenuating circumstances, and finals. I would like to retake this course as a self study in order to refresh some of the important algorithms topics in my mind.

## School Prep 2021
### School Course Prep Selection Thought Process
I picked these courses to study because I think these subjects are the ones I will struggle the most with. These picks weren't based on the level of interest in the subject.

### Courses
#### AP World History
Methods: Khan Academy + Textbook Dates: 8/1 - 8/30

Aptitude Test: WHAP Final Exam Score of 85+

Optional Aptitude Test (Used for refresher): AP Practice Exam Score of 5

***Results: Not Completed***

#### Pre-AP Chemistry

Methods: Khan Academy + YouTube + Tutoring (Group with Mihir if possible) Dates: 7/1 - 7/30

Aptitude Test: Pre-AP Chemistry Final Exam Score of 85+

***Results: Not Completed***
### Certificates
##### Mit 6.00.1x
