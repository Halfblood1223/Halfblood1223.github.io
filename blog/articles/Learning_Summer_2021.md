# Learning Summer 2021
## Math Summer 2021
### Math Course Selection Thought Process
Courses were selected in order to support my CS learning path. To take CS 189 next summer I will need a vector calculus, linear algebra, and probability course done. This summer I think that completing up to Calculus 1, and Linear Algebra is adequate to be able to take CS 189 by the end of next summer. It also allows me to take CS 188 sometime this year.

*Update 07/24*
This course selection seems quite ambitious at the current time. Given my workload and travel schedule I will be cutting down some of these courses and either removing them from my selections or pushing them into the school year. LinAlg was pushed to the school year. CS 61a was dropped. CS 188 and 6.00.2x are undecided as of now. However, it isn't likely they'll get underway before December given that I need CS 70 as a pre requisite as well as my additional math course work.

## School Prep 2021
### School Course Prep Selection Thought Process
I picked these courses to study because I think these subjects are the ones I will struggle the most with. These picks weren't based on the level of interest in the subject.

### Dropped
#### CS 61a - Berkeley
I attempted CS 61a as my first coding course however the level of difficulty was too high for me. Substituted it with [Mit 6.00.1x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) and finished with a 96. I plan to attempt CS 61a in order to have a good basis in CS fundamentals before attempting more difficult concepts such as algorithms, and machine learning.
> [Course Website]([https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa18/](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa18/))

Dropped because I don't think an introductory course will give me a good value for time.

### Certificates
##### Mit 6.00.1x
