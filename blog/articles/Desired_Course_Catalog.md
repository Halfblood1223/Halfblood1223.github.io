# Desired Course Catalog
This is a catalog of all the course I want to take in the future. This is a staging site for courses before I move them into a seasonal page.

#### Linear Algebra
Methods: MIT Open Courseware + Naveed Tutoring (If possible) Dates: 8/8 - 10/3

Aptitude Test: MIT Linear Algebra Final Exam Score of 70+

Optional Aptitude Test (Used for Refresher): Post-Calc Final Exam Score of 85+ (Need to determine if all materials covered will be included or if more learning is required)

#### CS 188 - Berkeley
I want to take CS 188 as my intro to Machine Learning and AI course. The prerequisites are CS 61a, and CS 70. Both of those are Berkeley courses.

#### 6.00.2x - MITx
If possible I would like to re-attempt 6.00.2x. I started this course in the Fall of freshman year but was unable to complete this due to extenuating circumstances, and finals. I would like to retake this course as a self study in order to refresh some of the important algorithms topics in my mind.
