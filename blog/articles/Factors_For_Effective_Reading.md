# Thoughts on Reading Effectively
Reading is an interesting topic for me. My reading history started around the second grade as an escape from a chaotic home life. I read a lot of YA fiction in this period such as Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Hunger Games. Throughout middle school my reading stagnated in large part due to the fact that I got a new phone. Now as I'm entering my second year of high school I'm attempting to resurect this old habit with some important changes. My preferred books for reading at the moment are of an educational/philosophical flavor. I'm also attempting to read some fiction classics such as the Count of Montecristo. 

With that background out of the way I'll get into my strategies for reading effectively. The first and arguably most important part of my approach is being properly rested and hydrated. In my experience reading while not in a peak physical state is both exhausting, and results in a lack of retention of information. If I find I have lost track of what I am reading more than 3-5 times then I will stop reading and either rest immediately or read at another time. I also make sure to get enough water before starting and I find that caffeine helps as well. After my physical state comes note taking. My setup consists of reading the book and thinking about connections to something else I know of. Anything notable that I think of I will write down in my phone notes app and revisit in a blog post. The final portion is consistency. Consistency is very helpful in reading because even if you don't feel up to reading that day you build the habit slowly and while less efficient it helps to give you that extra nudge.

Reading is a very introspective and meditative experience. In order to truly enjoy it you must have an optimal physical and mental state. If you want to remember the information you read notation is also very important. The final key is consistency as it builds your internal desire to read incrementally.
