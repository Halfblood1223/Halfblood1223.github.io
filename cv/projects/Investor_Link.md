# Investor Link

This project was designed to connect investors with founders. Created with Django and used various other tools including Stripe, and Redis. Overall the project took around 40-50 hours as it was my first Django project. Look forward to getting this hosted eventually and plan to do a tutorial on the creation of the site at some point.
